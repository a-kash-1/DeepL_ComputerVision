# DeepL_ComputerVision
List of scripts written while learning computer Vision

Much of the scripts are inspired from the works of Dr. Adrian Rosebrock. 

The following files contain

Vaninlla_GD.py - a numpy implementation of basic(vanilla) gradient descent
SGD.py - a numpy implementation of Stochastic Gradient Descent. 
Perceptron_Gates - A multi-layer perceptron implementation for logic gates
NeuralNetwork.py - A numpy implementation of backpropagation algorithm. 
Kernels.py - A numpy implementation of Kernels (aka filters) in image processing. The script lets you see the effects of different kernels on a sample image provided by the user.
